# LAN-Chess
This project allows two computers on the same LAN network to play Chess against each other through the command line.

## How it works

This project is composed of two components: (1) the server, and (2) the client. For every "game" of chess that is played, only one computer must be running the server. The client file for the game is merely in charge of receiving information from the server, displaying that information to the user, and then accepting a valid move from the user and transmitting it back to the server. The client does not handle any decision making, or any logistics of the game, it is simply in charge of translating the information from the server into something understandable for the client.
